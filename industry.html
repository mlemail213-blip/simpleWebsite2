      <h2>Data Science</h2>
      <p>Data science is a field I have recently taken a liking to last year. It was sparked by my interest in statistics and drew me to it as it is a growing field that is promising for finding a job. It is utilized in many different industries and will allow me to choose any additional area of interest I may have. The industry is a combination of many different characteristics including data collection, analysis, developing algorithms, and predictions.</p>

      <h2>Data Scientist</h2>
      <p>A career within data science that interests me is the job of a data scientist. This job would focus on collecting data that the company may need and using different programming languages to have the data in a form ready to be analyzed. They will also create visual aids of the data as well as predictions for other business members a part of the company may use them to make informed decisions. </p>

      <h2>Working with AI</h2>
      <p>In the data science industry it is becoming very apparent that AI usage is very prominent as it can help automate tasks, predict future data, and more. However, I strive to limit my AI usage both for the health of my education and for the health of the planet. With that in mind it can be difficult to stay true to my morals of taking care of the planet and my ambition to become a data scientist.</p>

      <h2>How I will Respond</h2>
      <p>To respond to this ethical issue my personal values shape that I will be loyal to the company I am employed by and adapt to try to break away from its use. The values also show I will still strive to love the Earth by exploring nature and learning new cultures that allow empathy to grow.</p>

      <h2>Possible Cybersecurity Issues that Could Arise in Data Science</h2>
      <p> In data science, the most used thing in the field is data. Data that attackers will want to steal for profit or for personal use. This means that Cybersecurity issues can be very prevalent as attackers could change the data to provide false predictions. </p>

      <h2>Cybersecurity Practices Within Data Science</h2>
      <p>To prevent cybersecurity breaches there are a few company wide policies and technology that can be implemented. One of which is Multi-factor Authentication which will help to protect online data, and another is physical data protection that can help secure any documents or models that have been printed or written. Lastly, encryption and VPNs are two other practices that can help secure the data sensitive in a breach.</p>
