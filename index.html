      <h2>Empathy</h2>
      <p>I believe in understanding other people's perspectives and feelings.</p>
      <p>Growing up in my school, I remember reading many books about unique people and learning about them and their struggles helped me 
        see different perspectives. I have since carried that on and continue to try to see the best in other people and understand what 
        their story is.</p>
      <p>Empathy is important to me because it is one of the most basic emotions humans can give to one another, kindness. It is an olive
         branch we can reach out to one another that can help ourselves and them with a sign of understanding. </p>
      <p>Without the value of empathy, people can be judgmental and cause harm to others mental and physical health whether they know 
        them or not.</p>

      <h2>Loyalty</h2>
      <p>I take good care of supporting those who have supported me.</p>
      <p>I believe there is a strong stigma in my surroundings about being unloyal. People around me, such as my friends and family, have 
        always had a connection or "clique" that made loyalty a strong value in myself. </p>
      <p>Loyalty is important because it is what keeps our bonds with each other happy. It is the glue that keeps different relationships 
        intact such as families, friendships, and even companies to consumers. </p>
      <p>Without loyalty new connections would keep forming without continuation, leading to an unpleasant world to live in. </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Adaptability</h2>
      <p>I value being able to adjust to new circumstances and overcome them. </p>
      <p>In my life I'll admit to not having too many great challenges that have required adaptability. This value instead comes from 
        having an older sister who both judges and is temperamental. Growing up, I found myself often adapting to her needs and what 
        would make her least upset. </p>
      <p>Adaptability is important because it can help us overcome unforeseen challenges and help to find a balanced life. Though our 
        personal selves are important, adapting to other people in the workforce or in our personal lives can help to make a more 
        enjoyable life for everyone. </p>
      <p>If we don't adapt, we will all be stuck in our challenges unable to break past them. </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Exploration</h2>
      <p>I believe in exploring both the world and new ideas and concepts. </p>
      <p>This value comes from a great love of travel. I have taken numerous family trips and have visited many countries and
         hopefully soon to be all 50 states. This love of travel is not only for adventure but also for the knowledge of learning 
         about new history, foods, and cultural practices. </p>
      <p>Seeing and learning about new topics and places can help to push myself to challenge the other values on this list such 
        as empathy and adaptability. It can also be enjoyable and relaxing to learn and travel if exploring the right things. </p>
      <p>If we do not explore our world and our minds, then we will be unable to grow as people. We will be set in what we have around 
        us unable to become our best selves. </p>
